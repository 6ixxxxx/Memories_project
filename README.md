## Things i plan to achieve with this Project

### Master Frontend and Backend Integration
- While working for my Startup i met a lot of issues of integrating with the backend, turns out Frontend Development is about more than colour and Fonts lol (Jk knew that already), so i took it upon myself to learn and build a project that involves both parts

### Master a CRUD system for future personal projects

###Practice More Redux
